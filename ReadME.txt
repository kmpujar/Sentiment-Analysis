NLTK (v3.3)
Scikit-learn (v0.20.0.)
Pandas (v0.17.1)

To run the program place 'NB.py' and 'SVM_refined.py', store the 'reviews.txt' in the same folder as 'NB.py' and 'SVM_refined.py'. It takes reviews.txt as the input and provides the classification accuracy for different models. 

Please Note: Run the files NB.py and 'SVM_refined.py' separately.
